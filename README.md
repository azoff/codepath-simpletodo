Simple ToDo App
================
An ToDo App for Android 4.2 (API 17). Created as a prequisite for [The Codepath Mobile Bootcamp][1].

Notable Differences
-------------------

- Created using IntelliJ instead of Eclipse
  - Rationale: I'd rather drive nails through my eyes than use Eclipse
- Uses a different layout hierarchy so that the App can work on many screen sizes.
